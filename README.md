<b>What is Schemator?</b></br>
Schemator is a simple Figma plugin which fixes the basic schema of a component. When building components at scale and in a distributed team it oftens get difficult to manage a common contract schema between engineers and designers. Schemator runs on your defined components, it safely parses through all your variants and sanitises and organises them as you'd like them.
